  Attach::Stuff - Attach stuff to other stuff

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Attach::Stuff;

    # You've got a board that's 26x34 mm, with two screw holes with a 
    # 2 mm diameter, spaced 3mm from the edge
    my $attach = Attach::Stuff->new({
        width                => 26,
        height               => 34,
        screw_default_radius => 1.25, # 2mm diameter, plus some wiggle room
        screw_holes          => [
            [ 3,       3 ],
            [ 26 - 3,  3 ],
        ],
    });
    my $svg = $attach->draw;
    print $svg->xmlify;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You've got stuff, like a PCB board, that needs to be attached to other stuff, 
like a lasercut enclosure. How do you attach the stuff to the other stuff?  
This is a question we ask a lot when doing homebuilt Internet of Things 
projects.  Perl has the "Internet" half down pat. This module is an attempt to 
improve the "Things" part.

Lasercutters and other CNC machines often work with SVGs. Or more likely SVGs 
can be converted into something that are converted into G-code by whatever turd 
of a software package came with your CNC machine.  Whatever the case, you can 
probably start with an SVG and work your way from there.

Before you can get there, you need measurements of the board and the location 
of the screw holes.  If you're lucky, you can find full schematics for your 
board that will tell you the sizes exactly.  If not, you'll need to get out 
some callipers and possibly do some guesswork.

Protip: if you had to guess on some of the locations, etch a prototype into 
cardboard. Then you can lay the board over the cardboard and see if it matches 
up right.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor.  Has the attributes below.  Note that all lengths are measured 
in millimeters.

=over 4

=item * width

=item * height

=item * screw_default_radius - All screws will be this radius.  Currently, there is no way to specify a screw with any other radius.  It's recommended to add a little extra to the radius to fit the screws through.

=item * screw_holes - Arrayref of arrayrefs of the x/y coords of screw holes

=back

=head2 draw

Draw based on the parameters given in the constructor. Returns an L<SVG> 
object.

=head2 mm_to_px

Takes a measurement in millimeters and returns the length in pixels according 
to the SVG standard. Useful if you need to draw more complex shapes for your 
board after Attach::Stuff did the basics.  See the C<examples/rpi_camera.pl> 
file in this distribution for an example of this.
